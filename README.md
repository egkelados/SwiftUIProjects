This repository contains my practice projects from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), a comprehensive guide to learning Swift and SwiftUI. These projects are part of my journey to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI and to explore various aspects of iOS development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Practice SwiftUI concepts and techniques.
- Build hands-on projects to reinforce theoretical knowledge.
- Learn and implement best practices for iOS development.
- Solve small challenges and answer insightful questions provided by Paul Hudson.

## Projects Included

This repository includes projects from various days and challenges of the Hacking with Swift guide. Each project focuses on a unique concept or feature of SwiftUI and iOS development:
| Project | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| **SnowSeeker** | A dynamic app showcasing advanced features like custom alignments and navigation. |
| **Flashzilla** |  A complex app implementing gestures and animations.|
| **HotProspects** | A meetup management app using QR codes and SwiftData. |

...and many more projects designed to teach real-world development skills.

## Key Features Learned

Throughout these projects, I focused on:
- Mastering SwiftUI's declarative UI framework.
- Understanding state management, including `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@Environment`.
- Implementing gestures, animations, and transitions for dynamic user interfaces.
- Storing and retrieving data using `UserDefaults`, `SwiftData`, the `Document Directory`, and `Codable`.
- Integrating with system frameworks like Core Location, MapKit.
- Managing third party dependencies with `SPM` including  [KeychainAccess](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/KeychainAccess) for secure storage.

## Lessons Learned

This journey has significantly improved my understanding of:
- Designing reusable components and views.
- Writing clean, maintainable SwiftUI code.
- Optimizing SwiftUI performance.
- Leveraging Swift's powerful features like `NavigationStack` for robust navigation and `Codable` for effortless encoding and decoding.
